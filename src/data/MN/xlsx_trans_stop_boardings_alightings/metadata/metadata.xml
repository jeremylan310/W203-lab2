Note: Records are provided for all regional transit service and stops, but boarding and alighting data are only shown for Metro Transit and Met Council provided services and for service from other providers that have agreed to the inclusion of their service in this data set.  
</abstract><purpose>To provide information on transit stop usage in the Twin Cities region.  

Note: This data set should only be used to determine stop level ridership patterns.  It cannot be used to summarize total route or system level ridership for the same time period.  The data set is aggregated at the stop level and is filtered to exclude non-representative days.  This will not match the total ridership calculated from APC or fare collection data.

Schedule: Weekday, Saturday or Sunday



Ons: Average daily boardings



Offs: Average daily alightings



Seq: The sequence of the stop on the route



PctSampled: The percentage of scheduled trips that were successfully sampled



Downtown:  Whether a stop was in the downtown fare zone in downtaon Minneapolis or St. Paul



Comments:  Information to help with interpretation of the data, such as whether a stop was closed for part of the sample period or represents a detour that would cause changes from other years.

**Note: The Group ID field is intended to allow stops that are either in the same location or very close proximity to be combined.  This includes the following situations: Location with different stops for bus arrival and departure times, transit centers, and other similar locations.  Note that in some cases, stops on intersecting streets are grouped together.  Care should be taken in using this field and the grouped stops should be considered on a case by case basis.
</eaover></overview></eainfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>All information except the boardings and alightings are based on the scheduled service that operated during the analysis time period.  

The regular route bus and BRT boardings and alightings data are averages from the Metro Transit automatic passenger counter system.  These data are averaged over approximately a three month period with certain non-standard days excluded from the averages.  Non-standard days include those with severe weather, special events, school break periods, and other days that do not have normal ridership patterns.

The light rail and commuter rail boardings data are summarized from separate systems.  Alightings data is not currently available for those services.</attraccr></attracc><complete>Stops affected by detours at this time are shown as they would be for regularly scheduled service.  Notes have been included for stops that were not in service for the entire time period.  The ridership reported shows the average for when the stop was in service.</complete><logic>Total boardings and alightings at the stop, route, provider and system levels will not always be equal.  This is due both to the variations in ridership patterns as well as the result of the data collection and aggregation processes.</logic><lineage><procstep><procdesc>Bus and BRT data are gathered via the Metro Transit automatic passenger counter (APC) system which is deployed on roughly 99% of all Metro Transit buses. APC data are processed daily to match boardings and alightings to the correct stop and scheduled trip. Some data are dropped or excluded from the aggregation if they are outside the expected ranges (i.e., if they are suspected of being anomalous). 

Light rail and commuter rail boarding data is based on analysis of fare collection systems and passenger sampling clerk ride checks.
